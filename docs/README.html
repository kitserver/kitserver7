Version history: <a href="history.txt">history.txt</a><br />
</div>
<div>
December 30, 2007 - <b>Kitserver 7.0.6</b><br />
Module Versions: <a href="#lodmixer">LOD Mixer 7.0.5</a>
</div>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Kitserver 7 is an add-on program for Pro Evolution Soccer 2008. It is a loader and manager 
for various modules.<br />
Currently the following features are implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable up to 4 controllers (for demo)
<li>Select quality levels which PES doesn't want you to choose
<li>Any window resolution supported, hidden fullscreen resolutions unlocked
<li>Manual/Automatic aspect ratio correction.
<li>Disable controller check for Master League/League/Cup games. This allows your
friend to play for the opposition team.
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
As in Kitserver 6, you have to unpack the archive to your PES installation
folder and run the setup.exe. What is new is that you can now also select your
settings.exe. This is necessary because some changes are only possible in that
file. simply select these both files (they should already be preselected) and
click "Install". If you choose that you don't want to use Kitserver any longer,
run setup.exe again and click "Remove". You can also install/remove Kitserver
only for one exe by setting the other one to "no action".
</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>

<p>
After installing Kitserver, you are asked if you want to enable all quality
levels. In PES2008, Konami doesn't allow you to choose a high quality level if
the game thinks your PC isn't good enough for that. If you click on "Yes", that
check is removed and you can try if they are right with their assumption.
Apart from that you can now choose 4 controllers in the "Controller" tab. That
means you can configure your gamepads here and later play with them. Note that
by default the keyboard is controller #1. If you setup your gamepad as first
controller, you can't play against someone using the keyboard and your gamepad.
For that, you shouldn't setup a gamepad as first controller but always as #2, #3
or #4. However you can't use your gamepad in the main menu then, that works only
with the first controller.

<h3>LOD Mixer configuration</h3>
</a>

<p>
LOD-Mixer is the module that allows to fine-tune some aspects of PES2008 graphics engine.<br />
Currently the following features are implemented: screen resolution, aspect ratio correction,
and LOD adjustment. All of these can be configured manually in kitserver's main 
configuration file (kitserver/config.txt), but also there is now a GUI program that
makes it even easier:
</p>

<img src="lodcfg.png" style="border:0"/>

<h5>1. Aspect Ratio.</h5>
<p>
PES2008 offers only two choices for aspect ratio - 4:3 and 16:9. However, lots of
LCD monitors don't exactly fit into either of these two. Often, a 16:10 ratio is
used, or even 16:9.6. This results in the picture being distored: players either
too fat or too skinny, and ball is not round.
</p>

<p>
With LOD Mixer, you can set the aspect ratio to whatever you want. Either let
LOD Mixer calculate it automatically - at run-time, using the current screen
width and height in pixels - or set the value manually. Automatic way would work quite
accurately, assuming the pixel is square. Sometimes, however, you would want to
set it manually. For example, i play on widescreen monitor, but using a 800x600 
resolution, because my video card is not powerful enough. The automatic 
calculation would give 4:3, but since the view is stretched to fill the entire 
screen, we need to account for that. Setting aspect ratio to 1.6 (which is a 
natural AR for my laptop) does the trick.
</p>

<h5>2. Screen Resolution.</h5>
<p>
You can set any screen resolution you want, if you play in a Windowed mode. Even
crazy screens like 1567x532 will work, but you're likely to suffer from 
performance problems on such cases.
Hidden fullscreen resolutions are fully unlocked now as well. However, only those
that your video card really supports in full-screen mode, will work. If you 
accidently choose an unsupported fullscreen resolution, then PES should still 
be able to start in a window.
</p>

<h5>3. LOD configuration.</h5>
<p>
LOD (Level-Of-Detail) algorithms are used in graphics engines to improve both
the picture quality and the speed of rendering, when drawing objects at various
distances from the viewer. The basic idea is that when the object is close to
the camera, one (very detailed) model is used. When it is far - another, simpler
model with less detail is used instead. It's much faster to render a low-poly
model of the object, and it typically looks better, when drawn in small size,
because it suffers less from aliasing. In theory, at least, 
that is how it is supposed to work.
</p>
<p>
For some inexplicable reason, PES series had always suffered from an overly-
conservative LOD configuration, where the switch to low-poly models would happen
way too soon, and that would result in various visible artifacts. In PES4-PES6,
examples were: balding players, and missing details on kits. In PES2008, the
players appear to have blurred generic faces, once they move slightly away from
the camera.
</p>
<p>
So, if you have a good PC and a fancy videocard with GPU cycles to spare, you
may fancy tunning the LOD sligtly to make the game engine display more detailed
models, even when they players are a bit away from the camera (Animation quality seems
to be affected by this as well). To do that, <b>move the sliders to the right.</b>
</p>
<p>
Also, if on the contrary, your machine is stuggling to run the game at a smooth
frame rate, you can try tunning the LOD sliders in the opposite direction - thus
making the engine switch to the low-poly models sooner than normal. This may
improve the framerate, although at the expense of picture quality. To achieve
that, <b>move the sliders to the left.</b>
</p>

<div class="minornote">
Note that in game versions 1.0 and 1.10, the second LOD slider had the default
value of <b>0.070</b>. In version 1.20, KONAMI had changed this value slightly 
and it is now <b>0.074</b>, which makes the game switch from LOD1 to LOD2
a tiny bit sooner than before (if default LOD configuration is used that is).
</div>

<h5>4. Controller check</h5>
<p>
This feature may be useful to people who like to play a tournament - a league or
cup together. PES 2008 doesn't allow human players to control both teams, unless
both of their selected teams are playing against each other in the match. With
this new feature, you can remove that limitation. Now, even if it is for example,
P1 vs. COM game, or P2 vs. COM - you can freely select which team you control
with each controller. So, you can both play on the same team, or you can let 
your friend control the opposition - to make things more interesting.
You can also now choose a "Spectator" mode for in tournaments.
