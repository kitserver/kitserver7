Kitserver 7 for PES2008 PC                               October 27, 2007
=============================================================================
Version 7.0.0d - the Philadelphia Release

FEATURES
---------------
- Enable up to 4 controllers (for demo)
- Select quality levels which PES doesn't want you to choose

INSTALLATION
---------------
As in Kitserver 6, you have to unpack the archive to your PES installation
folder and run the setup.exe. What is new is that you can now also select your
settings.exe. This is necessary because some changes are only possible in that
file. simply select these both files (they should already be preselected) and
click "Install". If you choose that you don't want to use Kitserver any longer,
run setup.exe again and click "Remove". You can also install/remove Kitserver
only for one exe by setting the other one to "no action".

HOW TO USE
---------------
After installing Kitserver, you are asked if you want to enable all quality
levels. In PES2008, Konami doesn't allow you to choose a high quality level if
the game thinks your PC isn't good enough for that. If you click on "Yes", that
check is removed and you can try if they are right with their assumption.
Apart from that you can now choose 4 controllers in the "Controller" tab. That
means you can configure your gamepads here and later play with them. Note that
by default the keyboard is controller #1. If you setup your gamepad as first
controller, you can't play against someone using the keyboard and your gamepad.
For that, you shouldn't setup a gamepad as first controller but always as #2, #3
or #4. However you can't use your gamepad in the main menu then, that works only
with the first controller.

Have a lot of fun,
